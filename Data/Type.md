# Type
A type is every distinct word in a [[Corpus|corpus]]. So with "The apple boys like boys who like apples". Here the 2 boys tokens are of the same type. So types can occure more often, so you can connect a frequency to them. Apple and apples are not the same type! 

Types are often unambigous. More than 80% in the English [[Languages|language]] are [[Ambiguity|unambious]]. But the types that are ambigious occur typically. Almost two thirds of the [[Token|tokens]] in a corpus are [[Ambiguity|ambigious]]
