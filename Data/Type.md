# Type
A type is every distinct entry in a [corpus](Corpus.md). So with “The apple boys like boys who like apples”. Here the 2 boys tokens are of the same type. So types can occur more often, so you can connect a frequency to them. Apple and apples are not the same type! 

Types are typically unambiguous. More than 80% of words in the English [language](../Languages/Languages.md) are [unambiguous](../Languages/Ambiguity.md). But the types that are [ambiguous.](../Languages/Ambiguity.md) occur frequently. Almost two thirds of the [tokens](Token.md) in a corpus are ambiguous.
