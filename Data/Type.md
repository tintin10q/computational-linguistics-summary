# Type
A type is every distinct word in a [corpus](Corpus.md). So with "The apple boys like boys who like apples". Here the 2 boys tokens are of the same type. So types can occure more often, so you can connect a frequency to them. Apple and apples are not the same type! 

Types are often unambigous. More than 80% in the English [language](../Languages/Languages.md) are [unambious](../Languages/Ambiguity.md). But the types that are ambigious occur typically. Almost two thirds of the [tokens](Token.md) in a corpus are [ambigious](../Languages/Ambiguity.md)
