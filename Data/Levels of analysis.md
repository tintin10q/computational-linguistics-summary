# Levels of analysis
Computational linguistics is about analysing and producing language with computers. You can analyse languages on different levels. Here they are:

## Phonology
Studies linguistic sounds to construct **inventories of sounds with a linguistic role**. A phonetic is a basic sound. There is a fixed list of basic sounds that humans can make. From these sounds words are formed. The idea of phonology is to analyse the languages by looking at the basic units. Because switching them up changes the meaning. **We won't look at this one much if at all**

## Segmentation
In the context of CL segmentation is the task of splitting text or speech into [symbols](Symbol.md) of the appropriate granularity. So in a text words a symbols, but they are made up of letter symbols etc. 

Segmenting speech is harder because it is unclear where the spaces are. Fun fact spaces where only invented 4 centuries ago!

## Morphology 
This studies how words are built up from smaller meaning-bearing units, the morphemes. The classic view of CL is that a morpheme is the smallest linguistic unit that can carry meaning. This is a controversial point, apparently. Morphological complexity varies between languages more simple or super complex. So the word "apple" is a morphine which means üçé. Then if you have "apples" you also have the morpheme s which means more than one apple. 

The complexity is determined by the amount of morphologic units are in one symbol. 

## Syntax
Studies of the set of rules, principles and processes for combining symbols according to the structure of the language. This asserts whenever a sentence is well-formed. **But it doesn't look at meaning at all**. So you can have something like the chicken cooked the ropes from the chimney. It is formed ok, but the meaning does not make sense. It is quite hard to make sentences which don't mean anything. 

## Lexical semantics 
This describes the meaning of single symbolic units like words, morphemes and collocations. It looks to classify and decompose lexical structures cross linguistically, and understand similarities. So this is about units analysing and comparing units of syntax. 

## Compositional Semantics
This studies how atomic meanings are combined into larger meaningful units, such as sentences, paragraphs etc. Because you can't just keep adding atomic units together. 

## Pragmatics
This analyses how context influences meaning. This encompasses semantics, linguistic knowledge of participants, situational context, shared knowledge, goals and intent. Super hard for computers to do. 

# What to do when analysing language 
1. Identify the language we are dealing with.
2. Identify the linguistic units of interest (letters, morphemes, words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs ...)
3. Find the structure beneath the service.
4. Understand what each symbol means.
5. Understand what the whole message aims to convey
6. Respond appropriately (by a computer) 

Number 6 is the gold jewel of this whole field. That is what it is all for.
