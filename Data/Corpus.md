# Corpuss

The main resource for data are corpora.

You have one corpus. And there are multiple corpora. 

A corpus is a **computer readable** collection of linguistic productions. Text, speech, gestures.


## Variants of Corpus 
So structured data. Copora are made by different people this also makes them vary a lot. 

- Who produced it?
	-	Age, gender, education, ethnicity....
- What language(s) is it?
- When was the text produced?
	- Synchronic corpus is if no time period information is in the corpus. 
	- Diachronic is when there is a time dimension. 
- For which goal or function was the corpus produced?
	-	Genre, medium

These questions make corpora vary.

## Choosing a corpus based on this is important.
Sentences in languages are mostly infinite. This is why choosing a corpus that is representative of the phenomenon you want to model is very important. Your model will only be as good as the data you base it on. 

## Properties of a corpus
- Crawled/manually curated 
	- Crawled is fetched from the internet 
- Balanced/imbalanced
- Single author/more authors 
- Diachronic/Synchronic 
	- Diachronic is organized along the time dimension
	- Synchronic is not organized along the time dimension
- Written/spoken/mixed/video (the modal)
- Single language/multi-language/parallel 
	- Parallel is when the different languages talk about the same things.
