# Treebank 

A treebank stores syntactic trees. Treebanks provide [[Data/Corpus.md|corpera]] consisting of syntactically annotated sentences. The pann Treebank has annotated the Brown, Switchboard, ATIS, and WSJ corpora and some Arabic and Chinese. More treebanks exist for other languages. 

The Penn treebank uses [[Languages/Grammar.md|bracketing]] to mark [[Languages/Constituency.md|constituents]]. Some phrases come with annotations about there grammatical funciton and semantic function. 

You can derive the grammar of a language with a treebank. However, langauge is infinite.
