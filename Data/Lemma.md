# Lemma
A lemma is the dictionary entry of a word. So this is always a word not just a character. Types and tokens can also be characters. So if you have "The ape shared bananas with the other apes" then ape and apes here are the same lemma. It is like removing the 's like the extra things. Walking and walk is the same lemma. Is and be also the same lemma.

## Lemmatization
Lemmatization is the process of reducing each word-form found in a corups to its corresponding lemma. 

### Examples
- Is → be  
- Went → Go
- Geese → Goose
- Best → Good
- Talked → Talk
- Apples → Apple

You go to the base form. Sometimes the base is language specific. Lemmatizers are specific for languages.
