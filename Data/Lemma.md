# Lemma
A lemma is the dictionary entry of a word. So this is always a word not just a character. Types and tokens can also be characters. So if you have "The ape shared bananas with the other apes" then ape and apes here are the same lemma. It is like removing the 's like the extra things. Walking and walk is the same lemma. Is and be also the same lemma.

The citation form is a [synonym](../Languages/Synonyms.md) for lemma. 

## Word forms 
 Word forms are the other possible versions of a lemma which mean the same thing. For instance the verb *sing*. Sing is the lemma for the word forms sing, sang and sung. 

## Lemmatization
Lemmatization is the process of **reducing each word-form** found in a corpus **to its corresponding lemma**.

### Examples
- Is → be  
- Went → Go
- Geese → Goose
- Best → Good
- Talked → Talk
- Apples → Apple

You go to the base form. Sometimes the base is language specific. Lemmatizers are specific for languages. 


## Word sense - Multiple meanings
Sometimes a lemma can have multiple meanings. When this occurs a lemma is called **polysemous** (have multiple senses). These multiple meanings lead to [ambiguity](../Languages/Ambiguity.md). In the book on page 103 the example of mouse is given. A mouse can be a rodent or an input device for a computer.  Each of these separate meanings is called a **word sense**.
