# Lexicon
A lexicon is a list of words enriched with some attributes. Plural is lexica. It is much simpler then a corpus. Usually a list of words within some domain or a list of words with some property often represented with numbers.

Lexica do not contain the semantics of the word. So a dictionaries is not lexicon.
