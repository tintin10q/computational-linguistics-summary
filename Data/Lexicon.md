# Lexicon
A lexicon is a list of words enriched with some attributes. Plural is lexica. It is much simpler than a [corpus](Corpus.md). Usually a list of words within some domain or a list of words with some property, often represented with numbers.

Lexica do not contain the semantics of the word. So a dictionary is **not** a lexicon.
