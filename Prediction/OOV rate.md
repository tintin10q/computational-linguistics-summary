# OOV rate 
When testing a [language model](Language%20Modeling.md) there might be words in the testing set that the language model has never seen before. This can be expressed in the OOV rate. The OOV rate is the percentage of words in the test set which never occur in training. If it is high, there is a representativity problem.
