# Prediction 
Closely related to [classification](../Classification/Classification.md) in language, but prediction is trying to anticipate **what comes next given what has happened before** rather assigning a class to an instance. 

The difference between classification and prediction is that with classification you try to predict nominal, classificatory or ordinal variables based on features of an input while with prediction you try to predict interval or ratio variables.

But you could see this as classification but just with a lot more classes to predict. Or an infinite number of classes you can predict.
