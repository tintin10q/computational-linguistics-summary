# Euclidean distance 
The Euclidian distance calculates the distance between two points by calculating the distance between each coordinate of the point then multiplying each distance by itself then summing all the distances from every coordinate and then taking the square root of that. If we have the two vectors $\textbf{v}$ and $\textbf{w}$ this can be expressed with math like so: $$d(\textbf{v}, \textbf{w}) = \sqrt{(\textbf{v}_{0}-\textbf{w}_{1})^2+(\textbf{v}_{0}-\textbf{w}_{1})^2+...+(\textbf{v}_{n}-\textbf{w}_{n})^2}$$ 
Here d stands for distance. 

For [embeddings](Embeddings.md) this is not a good measure of [similarity](Similarity.md) because it is heavily influenced by absolute large differences. For example, if the distance of only one coordinate is really high for instance 300 and all the other distances are around 3 then the computer still thinks the two embeddings v and w are far away from each other.
