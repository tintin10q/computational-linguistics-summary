# Goals

The goals of looking at natural languages are:

- Infer the componets symbols of a language, their roles, the rules for combining them, and their meaning.
- Formalize the rules for combining symbols
- Combine atomic meanings. Atomic is the smallest part so how do you combine the meanings of smallest parts.
- Understand large portions of text.
- Produce complex sentences.
