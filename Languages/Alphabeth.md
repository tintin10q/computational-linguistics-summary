# What is an alphabet?

An **alphabet** is a (finite) set of symbols that can be used to form [[Sentences|sentences]] or [[Words|words]]. 

An alphabet is the set of symbols that can be used to construct valid sequences in a [[Languages/Languages|language]].   

Some examples: 
- ${a, b, c}$
- ${a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h,i, j, k, l,n, o,p, q,r,s, t,u, v,w, y,z}$
- ${a, d, e, f,g, h, i, k,l, n, o, p,q, r, s, t, u, v,y, z}$
- ${0,1}$
- The set of Latin characters.
- Unicode set
- {if, else, while, for, return, try} ← keywords. Here if, then, else are their own symbols. 
- {if, else, raise, for, while, return, try} $\cup$ ASCII set 

## Examples
Given that the alphabet is almost always finite we can consider sequences of elements from the alphabet.  

For instance if the alphabets is {a, b, c} you can have sequences like this:
- a
- b
- c 
- ab
- cab
- $\epsilon$ ← Empty sequence. Always valid! Don't put the empty sequence in your alphabet.
