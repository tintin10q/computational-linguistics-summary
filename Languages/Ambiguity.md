# Ambiguity 
When something is ambiguous it means that it can mean multiple things. Additionally, it is also not really clear what the correct meaning should be.

Often humans can deal with things like ambigiuos sentences by looking at the context of the sentence or the speakers face expression but dealing with ambiguity is really hard for computers. Rule based systems can not deal well with ambiguity.  

When something is unambious the meaning is clear and can only mean one thing.
