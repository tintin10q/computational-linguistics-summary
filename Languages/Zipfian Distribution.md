# Zipfian Distribution
A ziphian distribution is often seen with [Natural languages](Natural%20languages.md). What this means is that the most frequent word is twice as likely to occur than the second most frequent word in a language. The second most frequent is twice as likely to ocure than the third frequent word in a language and so on. It doesn't have to be twice as likely, but it just means each rank is much less likely. This means that most of the probability mass is given to the smallest top. 

How frequent a word is can be expressed in the rank. The most frequent word has rank 1, the second most frequent word has rank 2 etc.

The right is in log space and the left is absolute.

This also holds for almost all natural languages. It also holds at the level of letters. Some letters appear more often than others.  

So each thing outside the top 50 is rare but all the rare things together still make up 30% of everything, so you still have to deal with it.
