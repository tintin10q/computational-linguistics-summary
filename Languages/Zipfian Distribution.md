# Zipfian Distribution 
With a Ziphian the most frequent class, in this course words, is twice as likely to occur than the second most frequent word in a language. The second most frequent is twice as likely to occur than the third frequent word in a language, and so on. It doesn't have to be twice as likely, but it just means each rank is much less likely. This means that most of the probability mass is given to the smallest top. 

A Ziphian distribution is often seen with [Natural languages](Natural%20languages.md).  

How frequent a word is can be expressed in the rank. The most frequent word has rank 1, the second most frequent word has rank 2 etc.

This also holds for almost all natural languages. It also holds at the level of letters. Some letters appear more often than others.  

So each thing outside the top 50 is rare, but all the rare things together still make up 30% of everything, so you still have to deal with it.
