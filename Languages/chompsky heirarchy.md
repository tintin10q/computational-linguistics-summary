## Types of grammars 
The chompsky heirarchy species types of languages. 

- Type 0: unrestricted grammars, recursively enumerable languages. 
	-	Require a turing machine for acceptance
	-	As expressive as any other computational formalism 
-	Type 1 Context sensitive grammars and languages 
-	Type 2 [[Context free grammars]] and languages 
	-	Parsed using a pushdown automa in polynomial time
-	Type 3 Regular grammars and languages
	-	Recognized by a finate state automata
	-	Require only linear time and constant space
	-	Equivalent to regular expressions 

	
Type 2 and 3 is treated in this course with [[regular languages]] and [[Regular expression]] and [[Context free grammars]].
